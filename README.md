# Nomad tales

This is a solo project from Scrimba where we needed to build a traveling journal in React.

### What I've used:
- React 18
- Vite
- PropTypes
- Netlify CLI Deploy

### What I learned:
I'm having a lot of fun with these projects, I forgot almost everything about React and [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/dashboard#overview) is making learning a lot of fun to learn it again!

- I learned how to migrate form React 17 to 18
- PropTypes and ESlint to make sure everything is correct
- Vite setup and how awesome it is.
- Using 'External Data', the project didn't ask for us to use API's yet, but would be almost the same, and for sure I would be comfortable doing it!
